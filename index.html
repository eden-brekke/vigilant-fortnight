            <p>Hello! My name is Eden! <br> 
            I am trained as a microbiologist, and my ultimate goal in life is to use technology and science together to progress medicine. <br>
            I love the smaller things in life, going out for a walk, sitting on discord and talking with my friends, spending time with my partner and my furbabies. <br>
            I'm very excited to learn software development, starting with HTML/CSS/Javascript with the eventual goal of learning Python.</p>
           
            <p>Here are some picture of my two fur babies, they mean the world to me!</p>

                <h4 id="Hobby">Hobby</h4>
            <p>I have a few hobbies, I love art, drawing, painting, crochet, any craft of any sort will hold my interest! <br>
            I also love cooking, I love to find recipes and make them my own, cooking in itself can be an artform for me. <br>
            However I spend most of my time playing video games with my friends, in particular FFXIV takes most of my free time. <br> 
            My main friend group are the Peppers! There are many of us but here is a lovely picture of three of us.</p>
